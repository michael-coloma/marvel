3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd marvel`.<br />
4.  (optional) Run `npm preinstall:windows`  to delete previous installation.<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._

## Note
- To avoid re-renders in development mode, you can comment out `React.StrictMode` in `index.tsx`. Although it is normal to wrap the app with `React.StrictMode` in development mode, this will result in one additional re-render.

- There is a tool in React Query to check the cache in `index.tsx`. It has been commented out, but it can be used to view the cache.

- According to the [API documentation](https://developer.marvel.com/docs#!/public/getComicsCharacterCollection_get_2) (Swagger Marvel), the comics can be ordered by the following fields: `focDate`, `onsaleDate`, `title`, `issueNumber`, and `modified`.

  I preferred not to use this parameter in the request because I want to choose between `focDate`, `onsaleDate`, `unlimitedDate`, and `digitalPurchaseDate`. The client might need this capability in the future.

  The code can receive more parameters, such as `orderBy`, if necessary. See `"src\marvel\infrastructure\api\clients\MarvelApiClient.ts"`.
